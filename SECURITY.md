3. Prepare fixes for all affected versions
4. Release new versions as soon as possible
5. Publicly disclose the vulnerability after it has been resolved

We follow a coordinated vulnerability disclosure approach:

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using Camouflage, consider the following security best practices:

1. Always update to the latest version to benefit from security fixes
